# pie analysis

Standalone local analytics transforms, DuckDB queries, and static dashboard build for pie run analytics.

## Purpose

This package is a human-facing and agent-facing view over the existing local analytics store. It is **not** a second source of truth.

Data flow:

```text
analytics source export or analytics store
  -> prepared intermediate model
  -> DuckDB database + SQL queries
  -> generated site-data JSON
  -> static localhost dashboard
```

> **Model ranking:** see `analysis/scripts/stratified-ranker.ts` for the stratified leaderboard — per-model entries ranked within complexity bands (low/medium/high) via a per-run complexity score, and assigned to buckets.

## Local dashboard data

Raw `run-analytics.json` exports and generated `analysis/site/data/*.json` are local analysis inputs/outputs. The dashboard server serves only the expected generated site-data files so accidental extra files in that directory do not affect the UI.

## Install

```bash
cd analysis
npm install
```

## Common commands

Inside `analysis/`:

```bash
cd analysis
npm run build-db
npm run query -- --name model_quality
npm run export-site-data
npm run validate-site-data
npm run build-site
npm run serve
npm run validate
```

From repo root (preferred shortcuts):

```bash
npm run analytics:build-db
npm run analytics:query -- --name model_quality
npm run analytics:export-site-data
npm run analytics:validate-site-data
npm run analytics:build-site
npm run analytics:serve
npm run analytics:validate
```

## Source inputs

By default, source-building scripts use the committed fixture:

- `analysis/fixtures/small-run-analytics.json`

Notes:

- `npm run build-db` and `npm run export-site-data` build from the fixture when no explicit source is provided (with a warning).
- `npm run query` reuses an existing `analysis/data/usage.duckdb` when present.
- `npm run validate-site-data` validates existing generated site data when present; otherwise it validates a temporary build from the selected source.
- `npm run serve` auto-refreshes `analysis/site/data/` from your local run store by default (prefers the current workspace hash under `../data/outcomes/`).

For real local data, use one of these explicit inputs:

### Option 1: export from VS Code

Use the command palette entry:

- `pie: Export Run Analytics`

Save the export to a git-ignored path such as `analysis/data/exports/run-analytics-export.json`, then point analysis scripts at it:

```bash
cd analysis
npm run export-site-data -- --export ./data/exports/run-analytics-export.json
```

### Option 2: read directly from a run store directory

```bash
cd analysis
npm run build-db -- --storage-dir ../data/outcomes/<workspace-hash>
npm run export-site-data -- --storage-dir ../data/outcomes/<workspace-hash>
```

## Generated outputs

Generated outputs are git-ignored:

- `analysis/data/usage.duckdb`
- `analysis/data/exports/*.json`
- `analysis/site/data/*.json`
- `analysis/site/dist/*`

Site-data files:

- `manifest.json`
- `overview.json`
- `run-summary.json`
- `model-quality.json`
- `verification-impact.json`
- `tool-usage.json`
- `treatment-comparison.json`
- `timeline.json`
- `model-leaderboard.json`

## Query names

```text
core_runs
model_quality
verification_impact
tool_usage
tool_failures
treatment_comparison
timeline
```

Example:

```bash
cd analysis
npm run query -- --name tool_usage --export ./data/exports/run-analytics-export.json
```

## Dashboard workflow

```bash
cd analysis
npm run serve
```

`npm run serve` will:

1. auto-detect your local run store under `../data/outcomes/`,
2. regenerate dashboard-ready `analysis/site/data/*.json`,
3. start the localhost dashboard server.

If multiple run stores exist and none matches the current workspace hash, `serve` will ask for an explicit source. You can always force one with:

```bash
npm run serve -- --storage-dir ../data/outcomes/<workspace-hash>
npm run serve -- --export ./data/exports/run-analytics-export.json
```

Then open the localhost URL printed by the server.

Do not rely on `file://` loading.

## Data quality notes

- **Tool failure classification**: Runs recorded before per-tool failure classification was added lack `failureCountsByNameAndKind`. For these runs, the pipeline falls back to `failureCountsByKind` (aggregate-level classification) and emits failures under a sentinel tool name `(unattributed)`.
- **Scoring gap**: Most runs are `closed_unscored` (no satisfaction/resolution data). Model quality and treatment comparison metrics are only meaningful for the scored subset.
- **Open runs excluded**: Verification impact and timeline metrics exclude open (in-progress) runs since they have no finalized outcome.
- **Token usage**: `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `cacheReadTokens`, and `cacheWriteTokens` are available when the provider reports them. Many older runs have zero token data.
- **Cost**: `estimatedCostUsd` is derived from token usage × per-model pricing in `models.json` (`null` when pricing is unknown, e.g. local/free models). The `core_runs`, `model_quality`, and `timeline` queries surface it per run, per model, and per day respectively. The dashboard's "Cost & token economics" section shows spend over time, spend per model, and average spend per model per session — a session rolls up all of its runs, so the per-session average differs from the per-run average when a session contains multiple runs.
- **Task group correlation**: Multiple runs can share the same `taskGroupId`. Per-run sample sizes in model quality and treatment comparison should be treated as upper bounds since runs in the same task group are not independent.
- **Small samples**: Model quality cells with fewer than 3 scored runs have highly variable satisfaction averages. Notes in `model-quality.json` flag this.

## Manual smoke test

1. Ensure you have local run data (use pie normally; optional: export manually with `pie: Export Run Analytics`).
2. Run `npm run serve` and open the localhost URL.
3. Optionally run `npm run validate-site-data` for an explicit contract check.
4. Confirm:
   - charts render,
   - global filters update multiple charts,
   - empty/no-scored subsets show useful messages,
   - browser devtools show no CDN or third-party requests.
