/**
 * Regression: composer draft must follow a pending session path when it
 * resolves to the real backend path.
 *
 * Bug: `handlePendingPathReplaced` migrated every per-session keyed map that
 * the composer cares about (pendingComposerInputsBySession, activeRunSummary-
 * BySession, analyticsFactorsBySession, sendQueueBySession) EXCEPT
 * `composer.draftTextBySession`. The user's in-progress draft, posted under
 * the pending path while the backend was creating the session, was orphaned on
 * the now-defunct pending path. The projected `draftText` for the resolved
 * session fell back to '' and the webview's `[sessionPath]` seed effect then
 * cleared whatever the user had typed — "some of their message getting cut
 * off" once the session finished loading.
 *
 * This mirrors the migration already applied to the sibling composer maps.
