/**
 * Single entry point for dispatching events to the CQRS reducer.

 * `dispatch` is a pure function: `(ArchState, Event) → { state, effects }`.
 * It has no side effects and holds no mutable state. The caller is
 * responsible for:
 * 1. Storing the new state (e.g. `this.archState = result.state`).
 * 2. Executing the returned effects (via `EffectRunner.run()`).
 * 3. Scheduling any render — there is no auto-projection here.
