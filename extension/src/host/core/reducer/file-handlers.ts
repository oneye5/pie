      // session.truncateAfter, or a SessionOpened refresh resolving a
      // different range) can make a path's visible `toolCallId` regress to an
      // earlier tool call and trip a false-positive demote-to-unread. This is

      // open (when re-derivation runs), and the only effect is demoting a file
      // back to unread (no data loss). After a truncate the file's diff is
      // genuinely different from what was reviewed, so a demote is arguably
