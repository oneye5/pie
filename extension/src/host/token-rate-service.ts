/**
 * Measures the live "tokens per second" indicator state for every running
 * session host-side, so the average keeps collecting even while a session is
 * not the active/selected tab. The webview simply displays the pre-computed
 * state for its active session — it no longer measures anything itself.
 *
 * Why host-side: the webview only ever receives the *active* session's
 * transcript (`ViewState.transcript`), so it literally could not measure a
 * background session. The host holds every session's transcript in
 * `transcript.bySession`, so it can measure all of them continuously with the
 * exact same `tickTokenRate` logic the webview used to run.
 *
 * The generation clock advances on the service's own {@link TICK_MS} interval
 * (independent of transcript flushes), so it still advances during output
 * stalls (counting them against the rate so it drops to reflect slow-downs
 * rather than freezing on a stale high value) and detects the generating →
 * paused transition at run end / tool calls / between turns even when no state
 * snapshot is otherwise being posted. When the active session's displayed
 * state changes, {@link onActiveRateChanged} is called so the host posts a
 * fresh snapshot (debounced by the sidebar provider).
 *
 * Side-effectful (wall-clock + `setInterval`) by design — it lives outside the
 * pure reducer, mirroring how the reducer purity contract keeps `Date.now()`/
 * timers out of `(State, Event) → State`.
