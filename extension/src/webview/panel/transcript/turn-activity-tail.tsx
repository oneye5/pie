/**
 * Render the live-activity tail as a fixed-height, terminal-style block.
 *
 * The block reserves a constant row budget per kind (the configured content-row
 * count for reasoning / reply text, plus one header row for a running tool /
 * subagent) so its height never changes as content streams in - that is what
 * stops the transcript from jumping around while the agent works. Rows render
 * top-to-bottom; the blinking caret attaches to the newest row.
 *
 * Tool / subagent tails merge their label (tool / agent name) and input (the
 * command / task) onto the first row as `label ▸ input`, so the caller and its
 * command share a line instead of consuming two. Reasoning and reply text have
 * no header row - the italic / muted styling already signals reasoning and the
 * caret signals reply, so a dedicated `reasoning...` label would just waste a row.
 *
 * Truncation ("more output exists above") is conveyed by a gentle top fade on
 * the content block rather than a dedicated `...` row, so the preview reads
 * seamlessly. The fade is driven by the actual rendered overflow: any time the
 * wrapped content is taller than the reserved block, the oldest (top) content
 * fades out. This catches both "many short source lines" and "one long line
 * that wraps across several rows".
 *
 * Console-style streaming. The body wraps to fill the reserved width and
 * collapses source newlines (joined with a space) so the limited preview rows
 * carry as much of the recent tail as possible. The text is bottom-anchored
 * (`bottom: 0`) so the newest row + caret stay pinned to the bottom and wrapped
 * overflow scrolls off the top — and, crucially, so the visible rows never shift
 * when the wrapped height changes (bottom-anchoring is immune to the height
 * wobble that a char-budgeted window used to cause, which made the preview slide
 * and jump). New tokens are buffered and revealed character-by-character at a
 * slow, readable rate (see `useBufferedText` with `TAIL_RATE`), so the preview
 * types into the current line like a typewriter — the x position of any placed
 * text never moves, only the caret advances.
 *
 * When a new row wraps in, `useTailConsoleScroll` runs a small push animation
 * (see the hook): it nudges the whole block down by one row-height with no
 * transition (so the freshly-wrapped row sits just below the view, restoring the
 * pre-wrap layout), then glides it back up over ~150ms. That glide scrolls every
 * row up by exactly one row-height: the oldest row slides off the top (clipped),
 * the rows in between follow, and the newest row slides in at the bottom — a
 * smooth, followable row-scroll instead of an instant jump the eye has to
 * re-acquire. The animation is detected off the wrapped line count exceeding its
 * historical peak, so height wobble never false-fires a scroll.

 * before paint) and, whenever it exceeds its historical peak, runs a two-step
 * push animation:
 *
 *  1. Translate the block DOWN by `deltaRows · rowHeight` with NO transition —
 *     this restores the pre-wrap layout (the freshly-wrapped row sits just below
 *     the view), so the frame that adds the new row never paints the jumped
 *     state. Applied in `useLayoutEffect` so it lands before paint (no flash).
 *  2. On the next animation frame, glide the translate back to `0` over ~150ms.
 *     That glide scrolls every row up by one row-height: the oldest row slides
 *     off the top (clipped), the rows in between follow, and the newest row
 *     slides in at the bottom — a smooth, followable row-scroll.
 *
 * Peak-based detection is what makes this robust: only a wrapped line count
 * that exceeds its all-time peak is treated as a real new row, so any height
 * wobble never false-fires a scroll. The baseline resets (without animating)
 * whenever the underlying stream is *replaced* rather than grown by appending
 * — mount, content (re)appearing, or a source switch (reasoning→reply, tool
 * A→tool B) — so the first row of a new stream just appears instead of
 * scrolling. Replacement is detected via `isForwardExtension` (not raw text
 * equality): a *growing* source is a continuation, so it never re-suppresses —
 * crucial, because the source grows on every posted snapshot, and re-suppressing
 * every snapshot would cut every in-flight glide and re-introduce the snap.
