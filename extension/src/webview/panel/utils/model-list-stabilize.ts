/**
 * Reference-stabilization helper for the host-delivered `availableModels`
 * array (`ViewState.availableModels`).
 *
 * The host re-serialises the whole `ViewState` on every `state` message
 * (≈7/sec while streaming, debounced to 150ms). `postMessage`'s structured
 * clone gives every array element a fresh reference even when its content is
 * byte-identical, which defeats the `memo()` / `useMemo` barriers downstream
 * that key on the `availableModels` ref — notably the model-state and
 * pricing-by-model-id memos in `useComposerIndicators`, and the `Composer` /
 * `BottomSection` / `VirtualRow` memo boundaries above the indicator layer.
 *
 * Unlike the flat config objects stabilised in `view-state-stabilize.ts`,
 * `ModelInfo` has nested object fields (`inputKinds[]`, `subagent?` with its
 * own nested `pricing?`), so {@link shallowConfigEqual} can't stabilise it (its
 * `primitiveCollectionsEqual` compares elements by `===`, which fails for the
 * freshly-cloned nested objects → reports "not equal" → no-op). Instead we
 * build a structural signature per model and compare signatures, mirroring the
 * `indicator-signature.ts` pattern. The signature covers every field that
 * downstream reads (id/name/provider/reasoning/inputKinds/contextWindow/
 * maxTokens + the full `subagent` shape including `pricing`), so a
 * byte-identical snapshot reuses the cached reference and a genuinely
 * different model list (new model, toggled eligibility, updated pricing) is
 * adopted. The caller owns the cached reference (module-level `let` in
 * `use-host-sync`); this helper is pure and stateless.
 *
 * Fails SAFE: any field the signature omits would also be omitted from the
 * comparison, but every observable `ModelInfo` field is included, so two
 * structurally-equal arrays always reuse the cached ref and two
 * structurally-different arrays never do.
 */

/**
 * Build a structural signature for a single {@link ModelInfo}. Covers every
 * field downstream code reads. `inputKinds` is joined in order (the array is
 * short and order is semantically meaningful for capability checks). The
 * optional `subagent` block is serialised field-by-field including its nested
 * `pricing` quadruple so that any pricing/eligibility/cost update is detected.
