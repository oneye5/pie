/**
 * Agent-directory resolution for the pie backend.
 *
 * The backend (pi SDK) resolves its config dir via `getAgentDir()`, which reads
 * `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`. That dir must contain `settings.json` and `models.json`
 * — the latter is the ONLY place custom providers (e.g. `umans`) are defined. A
 * built-in provider list without `umans` is the symptom of a wrong/empty agent
 * dir, NOT a missing auth key.
 *
 * This is a recurring failure: the VS Code User setting `pie.agentDir` is a
 * persisted absolute path that goes STALE whenever the repo is relocated or the
 * config is copied across machines (the installer writes the current path, but
 * a stale value already on disk — from a previous install on another machine —
 * is blindly trusted and silently overrides the correct OS env var). The result
 * is "umans provider missing" with no visible error.
 *
 * The robust contract here: a candidate dir is only trusted if it actually
 * contains `settings.json` (the file that defines an agent dir). Candidates are
 * tried in priority order; the first that validates wins. This makes the
 * previously-fatal "stale setting" scenario self-healing instead of silent.
