/**
 * Turn-latency stats. The average time-to-first-token is surfaced INLINE on
 * the generation-speed (tokens/sec) chip — always visible, e.g. `42 tok/s · 1.3s`
 * — while the full overhead / total breakdown lives in that chip's tooltip.
 * The latency breakdown is no longer a separate chip.
 *
 * Turn latency is the wall-clock gap from the previous tool call finishing (or
 * the prompt being sent, for the first turn) to the model's first reply token,
 * decomposed into our overhead vs the provider's. Each finished assistant
 * message carries the per-turn measurement (`turnLatencyMs` / `overheadMs` /
 * `providerLatencyMs`); here we average those across every measured turn in the
 * transcript so the speed chip's tooltip reports a stable typical latency
 * rather than the noisy single last turn.
 *
 * The average is session-wide (every measured turn in the transcript), not
 * per-run: latency is a historical statistic, and pooling all measured turns
 * yields a steadier number than the per-run sample (which may be just one or
 * two turns). The live generation rate on the same chip is per-run; the two
 * coexist in one tooltip.
 *
 * Pure transcript math (no I/O, no `Date.now()`), so it lives in `shared/` and
 * is consumed by both the host-side token-rate measurement and the webview.
 * The persisted per-turn breakdown lives on `TurnThroughputSample` in the host
 * analytics.
