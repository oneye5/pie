# Architecture Overview — Developer Onboarding

**Pattern:** CQRS-shaped Elm/MVI
**Authoritative contract:** [`docs/STATE_CONTRACT.md`](../STATE_CONTRACT.md)
**Migration plan:** [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §10`](../ARCHITECTURE.md)

> **Note:** This file describes the *target* architecture. The migration from Redux to pure CQRS is in progress. See §10 of ARCHITECTURE.md for the plan and current phase. Files marked as "target" do not yet exist; their responsibilities are currently handled by the modules listed in the current column.

## Three Processes

| Process | Role | Entry point |
|---------|------|-------------|
| PI backend | Language model + tool execution | External; communicates via JSON-RPC stdio |
| VS Code extension host | State, effects, projection, webview transport | `extension/src/host/extension-host.ts` |
| Webview (Preact) | Render + user input | `extension/src/webview/panel/app.tsx` |

---

## Spine Files

All core architecture types live in `extension/src/host/core/`:

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `commands.ts` | `Command` discriminated union — intents from webview. Each carries `corrId` + `sessionPath`. |
| `events.ts` | `Event` discriminated union — inputs to the reducer (commands, backend events, effect results). |
| `effects.ts` | `Effect` discriminated union — side-effect descriptors grouped into namespaces (`SessionRpc`, `SessionLifecycle`, `FileOperation`, `Notification`). |
| `reducer.ts` | Pure function `(ArchState, Event) → { archState, effects }`. No I/O. |
| `effect-runner.ts` | Executes effects, posts result events back to reducer. Owns no state. |
| `projection.ts` | Pure function `ArchState → ViewState`. Computes what the webview should display. |
| `backend-event-parser.ts` | Parses raw JSON lines from the PI backend into typed `BackendEvent` objects. |
| `message-router.ts` | Converts `WebviewToHostMessage` into `Command` objects and dispatches to the reducer. |

All application state lives in `ArchState` — no separate Redux store.

## Information Flow

```
                       ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
  Webview Command  ──► │                                         │
  Backend Event    ──► │   Reducer: (ArchState, Event)           │
  EffectResult     ──► │      → { archState', effects: Effect[] } │
  Timer Msg        ──► │   (pure — no I/O, no Redux)             │
                       └──────────┬───────────────────────────────┘

     Projection: ArchState → ViewState    EffectRunner executes:
                │                           - RPCs to PI backend
                ▼                           - File operations
       Patch{sessionPath, ops}              - Notifications
                │                           - Analytics export
                ▼                           Results → Event
       Per-session revision channel
                │
                ▼
       Webview mirror[sessionPath]
                │
                ▼
       Render active session
```

## ArchState Sub-States

| Sub-state | Contains | Former slice |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `transcript` | Messages, deltas, tool calls, pruning results, message status, editing state | `transcript-slice` + editing from `ui-slice` |
| `sessions` | Session list, running states, unread marks, active path | `sessions-slice` |
| `settings` | Model settings, chat prefs, pruning config, available models, backend ready | `settings-slice` + `ui-slice` (backendReady) |
| `composer` | Pending composer inputs, active run summaries | `session-state-slice` (partial) |
| `fileChanges` | File change entries, derived state | `file-changes-slice` |
| `pending` | Optimistic ops table, interrupt flags | was already in `ArchState` |

---

## Glossary

| Term | Definition | Source file |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Command** | Webview → host intent, carries `corrId` | `host/core/commands.ts` |
| **Event** | Reducer input (command, backend event, or effect result) | `host/core/events.ts` |
| **Effect** | Plain data describing a side effect, grouped by namespace | `host/core/effects.ts` |
| **EffectRunner** | Executes effects, produces result events | `host/core/effect-runner.ts` |
| **Projection** | `ArchState → ViewState` | `host/core/projection.ts` |
| **ArchState** | All application state, nested into sub-states | `host/core/reducer.ts` (type) |
| **Patch** | Session-addressed diff of ViewState | `shared/protocol.ts` |
| **Snapshot** | Full ViewState for recovery | `shared/protocol.ts` |
| **Mirror** | Webview-side cache of ViewState per session | `webview/panel/hooks/use-host-sync.ts` |

---

## Key Invariants

1. The reducer is pure — no I/O, no `Date.now()`, no randomness.
2. Side effects only happen inside the EffectRunner.
3. Webview never mutates logic state directly — it dispatches Commands and applies Patches/Snapshots.
4. Every Patch and session-scoped backend event carries an explicit `sessionPath`.
5. Optimistic state is tagged with `corrId` and reconciled by matching `EffectResult`.
6. Background-tab patches update that tab's mirror; they are never dropped.
7. Host state uses `Record<string, T>` only (no `Map`/`Set`).
8. See `STATE_CONTRACT.md` for the full set.

## Effect Routing

| Effect category | Queue path |
|-----------------|----------|
| `SessionRpc` (Send, Edit, Interrupt, Truncate) | `enqueueLifecycle → enqueueSessionOperation(sessionPath, doRpc)` |
| `SessionLifecycle` (Open, Create) | `enqueueLifecycle(...)` only |
| `FileOperation` (Diff, Revert, Export) | Direct execution, no queue |
| `Notification` (Flash, Sound) | Direct execution, no queue |
| `Log` | Direct execution, no queue |

> **Note:** `FileOperation` and `Notification` effect namespaces are target architecture. Currently file operations and notifications are handled imperatively in `extension-host.ts`.

---

## Webview State Rules

The webview owns **only** ephemeral render concerns:
- Scroll/focus/hover/drag/animation state
- Protocol bookkeeping (revision refs, snapshot flags)
- Per-keystroke draft buffer (committed draft is host state)
- Token-rate telemetry

Everything else is host state delivered via ViewState. See `STATE_CONTRACT.md § Webview-Local State`.

## Where To Make Changes

| Task | Files to touch |
|------|---------------|
| New user action | `commands.ts` → `events.ts` → `reducer.ts` → `effects.ts` → `effect-runner.ts` → `message-router.ts` |
| New backend event | `events.ts` → `backend-event-parser.ts` → `reducer.ts` (+ `effects.ts` if side-effects needed) |
| New ViewState field | `projection.ts` → `shared/protocol.ts` → webview consumer |
| New effect type | `effects.ts` (in the right namespace) → `effect-runner.ts` → `events.ts` (result event) |
| New webview component | `webview/panel/components/` → import in `app.tsx` |
