# Model Token Pricing Evidence Ledger

**Purpose:** Authoritative traceability record for every price written to `models.json`.
Every non-zero cost field in `models.json` MUST have a corresponding row in this document.

**Retrieval date:** 2026-06-19 (Ollama Cloud refreshed live via OpenRouter; Umans section added; Copilot unchanged)
**Format:** All prices in USD per 1M tokens unless otherwise noted.

---

## Methodology

For each model in `model-profiles.yaml`:
- **GitHub Copilot models**: Token pricing sourced from official GitHub Copilot billing documentation. 1 AI credit = $0.01 USD.
- **Ollama Cloud models**: Live per-token pricing from the [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models) model API (`pricing.prompt` / `pricing.completion` / `pricing.input_cache_read`), converted from USD-per-token to USD per 1M tokens. OpenRouter aggregates upstream provider rates (DeepSeek, Google, z-ai/GLM, Moonshot/Kimi, Alibaba/Qwen, MiniMax, NVIDIA, OpenAI); these are real billed rates, not compute estimates. The earlier H100-@-$3/hr compute-estimate methodology is preserved in `ollama-pro-cloud-models-ranked.md` for historical reference only.
- **Umans models**: Subscription coding plans (`api.code.umans.ai`) — unlimited tokens for the plan holder, so per-token marginal cost is $0. Per-token "service keys for teams" exist but are out of scope for the personal plan key configured here. Cache usage is still captured for token accounting (see Umans section).
- **Ollama Local models**: Free/local (no API cost).
- **Grok models**: No official token pricing found; marked as unknown.

### Confidence levels

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `official` | Published on provider's official pricing page |
| `official-inferred` | Derived from official data with documented formula |
| `openrouter` | Sourced live from the OpenRouter model pricing API (aggregates upstream provider rates) |
| `third-party` | From independent analysis or compute estimates (historical compute-estimate methodology) |
| `unknown` | No reliable pricing found |

## Ollama Cloud Models

**Source:** [OpenRouter `/api/v1/models`](https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models) — live aggregator of upstream provider per-token rates.
**Retrieval date:** 2026-06-19
**Confidence:** `openrouter`
**Units:** USD per 1M tokens.

Each Ollama Cloud model is mapped to its OpenRouter slug (e.g. `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` → `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`). `cacheRead` is populated where OpenRouter exposes `input_cache_read`; `—` means the upstream provider does not publish a separate cache-read discount for that model (cache read billed at the input rate, or no caching tier). `cacheWrite` is `0` for every cloud model: where the upstream charges for cache creation it does so at the input rate (DeepSeek, Kimi) or bills context caching per-hour (Gemini, GLM) — neither is a per-token cache-write line item.

## Umans Models (code by Umans)

**Provider:** `api.code.umans.ai` (OpenAI-compatible). Per [umans.ai](https://umans.ai), the service is
subscription-first: hosted Kimi K2.6/K2.7-Code, GLM 5.1/5.2, Qwen 3.6 35B-A3B, plus Umans-coder/flash,
offered as **coding plans with unlimited tokens** (Pro ~$17–20/mo). The configured `$UMANS_API_KEY` is a
plan key, so the per-token marginal cost is **$0** — `input`/`output`/`cacheRead`/`cacheWrite` are all `0`
in `models.json`.

A separate **per-token "service keys for teams"** tier exists but is not configured here; if a service key
is adopted, populate these cost blocks from Umans's published per-token rates.

Cache usage is still captured for token accounting and the context-window indicator: Umans uses the same
`openai-completions` API path as Ollama, and the host usage parser (`extension/src/backend/transcript/content.ts`,
`usageFromMessage`) reads cache tokens from `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` / `cache_read_input_tokens` /
`prompt_cache_hit_tokens` — the standard fields Kimi/GLM/Qwen return. No Umans-specific wiring is required.

| Model ID | Input | Output | Cache Read | Cache Write | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| umans-coder | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | official | Subscription plan; unlimited tokens |
| umans-flash | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | official | Subscription plan; unlimited tokens |

| umans-glm-5.2 | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | official | Subscription plan; unlimited tokens |
| umans-qwen3.6-35b-a3b | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | official | Subscription plan; unlimited tokens; newly added model |

## Normalization Baseline

For the normalized cost calculation (`estimateNormalizedCost()`), the baseline is:

- **Baseline model**: `claude-sonnet-4.6` (via Copilot)
- **Baseline pricing**: $3.00/M input, $15.00/M output
- **Blended baseline** (3:1 input:output ratio): `(3 * 3.00 + 1 * 15.00) / 4 = $6.00 / 1M`
- **Normalized baseline**: $6.00/1M maps to `cost ≈ 10` on the legacy selector scale
- **Formula**: `normalizedCost = 10 * sqrt(blendedUsdPer1M / 6.00)`
- **Legacy `cost=10` maps to**: ~$6.00/1M blended (sonnet-4.6 tier)

This baseline was chosen because:
1. Sonnet 4.6 already has `cost: 10` in model-profiles.yaml as the established baseline
2. $3/$15 per 1M is officially published by GitHub Copilot
3. The 3:1 token ratio is representative of agentic coding workloads

---

## Gap Analysis

Models in `model-profiles.yaml` without pricing in this evidence document:

| Model ID | Reason |
|---|---|
| grok-code-fast-1 | No official token pricing published by GitHub Copilot. Only multiplier-based pricing exists in the old premium-request model. Use legacy `cost: 13` in model-profiles.yaml until token pricing is published. |

No models remain at `unknown` confidence as of 2026-06-19:
- `gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud` — previously range-only; now priced via OpenRouter (`google/gemini-3-flash-preview`).
- `glm-5.2:cloud` — previously "TBD" in the Portkey snapshot; now priced via OpenRouter (`z-ai/glm-5.2`).
- Umans models — intentionally $0 (subscription unlimited-token plans); see Umans section.

## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-06-01 | Initial evidence ledger created. Copilot pricing sourced from official docs (via internal copilot-model-pricing.md). Ollama Cloud pricing from compute estimates (via ollama-pro-cloud-models-ranked.md). |
| 2026-06-15 | Synced Ollama Cloud model list: added glm-5, kimi-k2.7-code, minimax-m2.1, minimax-m2.5; removed 21 models no longer on cloud page |
| 2026-06-17 | Added `glm-5.2:cloud` with compute-estimate pricing (active params estimated 40B pending official spec) |
| 2026-06-19 | **Ollama Cloud refresh to live API pricing.** Replaced stale compute-estimate cost blocks for all 22 compute-estimate Ollama Cloud models with live per-token rates from the OpenRouter model API (`/api/v1/models`), including cache-read where OpenRouter exposes it, and added the previously-missing `glm-5.2:cloud` price (`z-ai/glm-5.2`). Supersedes the 2026-06-04 Portkey snapshot (several Portkey values were stale or mis-mapped, e.g. `kimi-k2.7-code` had matched base `kimi-k2`, `minimax-m3` was 2× the live rate). Added the Umans section (subscription → $0/token; cache captured via the shared `openai-completions` path) and the newly-listed `umans-qwen3.6-35b-a3b` model + profile. Copilot models unchanged (already official GitHub token pricing). |
