# UX & Reliability Remediation — Manual Smoke-Test Checklist

> Companion to `docs/UX_RELIABILITY_PLAN.md` §12 (verification matrix) and
> `docs/HANDOFF_UX_RELIABILITY_REMAINING.md` Bucket 3. The Briefs A–H are
> implemented and unit-tested; this checklist covers the scenarios that need a
> **real backend / human interaction** (they can't be app-smoke'd without a fake
> backend). Run it after any change that touches the host↔backend RPC boundary,
> the prepass lifecycle, the snapshot/reconciliation path, or error surfacing.

**Goal:** confirm the `Failed to send message: Timed out waiting for response to
req-NN` error is gone, errors are plain-language + actionable (no `req-NN`), and
the editing/interrupting/multi-prompt/stale-state flows feel right — judged
against Nielsen's 10 heuristics.

## 0. What's already automated (don't re-run here)

These are covered by unit/app-smoke tests — they are the regression net, not the
smoke matrix. Run `cd extension && npm run test` (1709+ tests) as the gate.

| Scenario | Automated coverage | Test file(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Paste-image clear/restore (Brief C) | app-smoke | `app-smoke.test.ts` |
| Second-send rejection (Brief E) | app-smoke | `app-smoke.test.ts` (in-repo) |
| Prepass chip phase render (Brief F) | app-smoke + reducer | `prepass-status-chip.test.ts`, `arch-reducer.test.ts` |
| Revision-discard / host-instance rebase (Brief D) | app-smoke | `app-smoke.test.ts` |
| NoticeBanner action buttons render + post the right message (Brief H) | app-smoke | `app-smoke.test.ts` |
| Retry re-sends the LIVE draft; disablePruning restores (Brief H) | app-smoke + effect-runner + reducer | `app-smoke.test.ts`, `arch-effect-runner.test.ts`, `arch-reducer.test.ts` |
| Interrupt one-frame "Stopping…" (Brief E) | app-smoke | `app-smoke.test.ts` |
| Error mapper: no `req-NN`, decimal-budget (Brief H) | unit | `error-mapping.test.ts` |
| Prepass succeeded/idle transitions (Brief F) | reducer | `arch-reducer.test.ts` |
| Resnapshot strictly-higher revision (Brief D) | unit | `sidebar-sync.test.ts` |

**Manual scenarios below** are the ones that need a live backend or a wedged
transport — they verify the *integration* the unit tests can't.

---

## Prerequisites

- A workspace with the pie extension installed (`cd extension && npm run build`
  after any `extension/src/` change — the build syncs to the installed VS Code
  extension).
- A model configured (the prepass runs the configured `pruningModel`).
- Pruning **enabled** (`pruning.mode: auto` in settings) for scenarios 1, 3, 5.
- DevTools open on the webview (Help → Toggle Developer Tools, or the
  "Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools" command) to inspect posted messages
  and to wedge the transport (scenario 6).

### How to make the prepass artificially slow (scenarios 1, 5)

The prepass is the `skill-pruner` `before_agent_start` LLM call. To slow it:

- Set `pruning.model` to a **slow / high-latency** model (or one that is
  rate-limited), **or**
- Lower `prepassTimeoutSec` to a few seconds (e.g. `3`) so a normal prepass
  approaches the budget — this exercises the send-timer / `prepass-timeout`
  path without needing a genuinely slow model. Keep it high enough that a
  legitimate prepass completes (e.g. `8`) for the "no false timeout" checks.

> The host infers the prepass START at send dispatch (no SDK `preflightStarted`
> event today — a cross-repo refinement, see `TODO.md`). So the live chip's
> elapsed-time has a small (send-dispatch → preflight-callback) error bound.

### How to force a backend stderr / parse failure (scenario 7)

- **Stderr:** kill the backend child process out-of-band
  (`pie.restartBackend` restarts it; or stop it hard and let the host detect the
  exit). The next send should surface a `backend-exit` notice
  ("The pie backend stopped unexpectedly…") with a **Restart backend** button.
- **Parse failure / dropped line:** inject a malformed line into the backend
  stdout (e.g. a debug build that writes a non-JSON line to stdout, or a
  skill-pruner `process.stderr.write` that the host's 64KB stderr ring captures).
  The send should surface a `dropped-line` notice
  ("The backend sent a malformed response…") with **Retry** + **Show logs**.

---

## Scenario 1 — Slow prepass: no `req-NN` timeout + live chip + cancel

**Briefs:** A (early-ack), F (prepass chip), B (send-timer), E (cancel).

1. Ensure pruning is enabled with a slow prepass (see Prerequisites).
2. Send a turn whose prepass will take well over the old 30s `message.send`
   default (e.g. a long transcript that triggers a big prepass, or a slow
   pruning model).
3. **Expected:**
   - The user message appears **immediately** (early-ack — Brief A). No
     `Failed to send message: Timed out waiting for response to req-NN`.
   - A live **prepass status chip** renders ("Pruning context… {elapsed}s")
     with a **Cancel** affordance (Brief F).
   - The send-timer (Brief B) does **not** fire prematurely while the prepass
     legitimately progresses — the chip clears at the first streaming delta
     (commit point), not at ack.
4. **Cancel mid-prepass:** click the chip's Cancel (or the Stop button).
   - The prepass is aborted (Brief E's cancel hook aborts the in-flight
     `message.send`); the UI reflects "Stopping…" within one frame; the
     optimistic message rolls back + composer inputs restore (Brief C).
5. **Failure path (optional):** set `prepassTimeoutSec` low enough that the
   prepass genuinely exceeds the send-timer budget. Expect a `prepass-timeout`
   notice naming the budget ("Pruning took too long to start this turn (it
   exceeded the Ns budget)") with **Retry** / **Retry without pruning** /
   **Open settings** — no `req-NN`.

---

## Scenario 2 — Pasted image clears instantly + restores on reject

**Briefs:** C (composer-input lifecycle), H (recovery).

1. Paste/drop an image into the composer. Confirm the attachment card shows.
2. Send the turn.
3. **Expected:** the image **disappears from the composer immediately** on send
   (cleared at send time — Brief C), regardless of prepass duration.
4. **Restore on reject:** trigger a pre-ack send failure (e.g. kill the backend
   between paste and the send RPC acking, or use a model that rejects). The
   `sendRejected` imperative restores **both** the draft text AND the image to
   the composer (no data loss). The restored image is staged as a transient
   override until the next snapshot confirms.
5. **Post-ack reject (Brief A/C):** if the prepass fails after ack, the same
   restore happens from `pending.promoted[corrId].inputs`.

---

## Scenario 3 — Edit a mid-transcript message: no truncated-frame flash

**Briefs:** E (edit pipeline invisibility), D (preserve-decision).

1. With a turn streaming or just finished, click **Edit** on a mid-transcript
   user message, change the text, and submit.
2. **Expected:**
   - The view **stays stable** — no flash of the truncated transcript before the
     new send's first delta lands (the `busy || hostRunning` preserve-decision +
     the webview revision/length-identity guards keep the pre-truncate view).
   - The optimistic edit message replaces the original; the new turn streams
     after the prepass.
3. If a `session.opened` snapshot arrives mid-edit (e.g. a tab refocus), the
   optimistic edit content **survives** — the snapshot does not overwrite it
   with stale backend content.

> The webview-side guard is covered by `app-smoke.test.ts` (revision-discard);
> the host-side preserve-decision is code-read-verified. This manual scenario
> is the end-to-end visual confirmation.

---

## Scenario 4 — Interrupt: UI stops within one frame; slow send abortable

**Briefs:** E (interrupt responsiveness), B (cancel hook).

1. Start a streaming turn (busy).
2. Click **Stop**.
3. **Expected:** the button flips to a disabled **"Stopping…"** within one frame
   (Brief E's optimistic `interrupting` flag), BEFORE the host round-trip clears
   `busy`. (Automated: `app-smoke.test.ts` "Brief E: interrupt reflects…".)
4. **Slow-send abort:** start a turn whose prepass is slow (scenario 1), then
   click Stop while the prepass runs. The in-flight `message.send` is aborted
   via Brief B's cancel hook (the `AbortController` passed to `backend.request`);
   the send does **not** wait for its timeout to elapse.

---

## Scenario 5 — Second prompt while a turn is in-flight: clear rejection, no queue

**Briefs:** E (rapid multi-prompt), H (error messaging).

1. Start a streaming turn (busy).
2. Type a second prompt and send **while the first turn is still running**.
3. **Expected:** a clear, actionable rejection — **no** `req-NN`, **no** deferred-
   prompt queue built. The notice names the next action in prose ("A turn is
   already running — interrupt it first, or wait"). The composer draft is
   preserved (not cleared) so the user can send once the turn finishes.
4. Interrupt the running turn, then send the queued draft — it sends normally.

---

## Scenario 6 — Wedge the webview (delayed acks) during streaming: converges without old+new overlap

**Briefs:** D (stale-state / snapshot recovery), G (memoized projection).

> **Bucket 2 item 3** — the one scenario not unit-tested end-to-end (a full
> streaming-wedge harness is too heavy; the mechanism is code-read-verified +
> covered by the revision-discard unit test). This is the human confirmation.

1. Start a streaming turn.
2. **Wedge the transport:** in the webview DevTools console, intercept the
   `message` event handler so acks (`stateApplied`) are delayed (e.g. wrap
   `window.postMessage` / the host's `postMessage` to defer delivery by ~500ms).
   Alternatively, throttle the VS Code webview to simulate a slow host→webview
   post.
3. While acks are delayed, let the host continue posting streaming deltas +
   snapshots (the host's `globalDirty` flag will mark the snapshot dirty on a
   failed/undelivered post).
4. **Expected:**
   - The view **converges** to the authoritative state without showing old + new
     messages simultaneously. Out-of-order / duplicate envelopes are **discarded**
     by the webview revision guard (`revision <= lastApplied` → drop).
   - The watchdog's **resnapshot** self-heals (re-posts the dirty snapshot with a
     **strictly-higher** revision — `buildStateEnvelope` always does
     `globalRevision + 1`; verified by `sidebar-sync.test.ts`).
   - The watchdog's consecutive-timeout **force-reload is suppressed while
     streaming** (`runningCount > 0`) — this is a **correct invariant**: a
     mid-stream reload would discard transient streaming state and produce the
     exact "old + new at once" symptom. **Do not "fix" this suppression.**
5. Restore normal ack delivery. The view settles to the final authoritative
   state with no leftover stale overlay.

---

## Scenario 7 — Force a backend stderr/parse failure: actionable plain-language error, no `req-NN`

**Briefs:** H (error messaging), B (correlation diagnostics).

1. Force a backend failure (see Prerequisites): kill the backend, or inject a
   malformed stdout line.
2. Send a turn (or let an in-flight turn hit the failure).
3. **Expected:** a plain-language notice that **names the problem + offers a
   concrete recovery action** — **no internal `req-NN` id** anywhere in the UI.
   - Backend exit → `backend-exit`: "The pie backend stopped unexpectedly.
     Restart the backend, then retry your message." + **Restart backend** +
     **Show logs**.
   - Dropped line → `dropped-line`: "The backend sent a malformed response. You
     can retry, or show the logs for details." + **Retry** + **Show logs**.
   - Prepass failure → `prepass-failed` / `prepass-timeout`: includes the
     sanitized backend detail (any `req-NN` stripped) + **Retry** /
     **Retry without pruning**.
4. **Recovery actions** (Brief H, now wired):
   - **Retry** re-sends the live composer draft as a `retrySend` (honoring an
     edit between rejection and retry — `draftRestore` would be stale).
   - **Retry without pruning** disables pruning atomically before the re-send,
     then **restores the prior pruning mode** once the retried turn commits
     (commit point / fire / pre-ack failure — verified by
     `arch-effect-runner.test.ts`). Pruning is **not** left permanently off.
   - **Show logs** opens the pie OutputChannel; **Open settings** opens
     `settings.json` (filtered to "pie" if the file can't be resolved).
   - **Restart backend** runs `pie.restartBackend` and dismisses the notice.
   - Retry + Restart **dismiss** the notice; Show logs / Open settings do **not**
     (the error still stands — the user just opened a surface).
5. Confirm the raw error is still **logged host-side** (diagnostics not lost) —
   only the user-facing string is sanitized.

---

## Done-criteria for this checklist

- All 7 scenarios pass with the expected behavior.
- No `req-NN` id appears anywhere in the UI across any scenario.
- No "old + new message at once" during scenario 6.
- Pruning is restored to the user's prior mode after a "retry without pruning"
  (scenario 7) — verify in settings after the retried turn commits.
- `cd extension && npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build` green.

Record any deviation as a follow-up in `TODO.md`.
