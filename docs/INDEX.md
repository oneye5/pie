# Documentation index

This folder mixes design contracts, implementation plans (some completed, some open), and historical brain-dumps. Use this index instead of scanning the directory.

## Active design contracts (read first)

- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) — **primary architecture reference**. System overview, pattern explanation, data flow scenarios, extension-point recipes, and invariants. Start here.
- [STATE_CONTRACT.md](STATE_CONTRACT.md) — authoritative rules for host ↔ webview state sync. Any change here requires matching tests in `extension/test/` (see `sync-contract.test.ts`).
- [internal/ARCH-OVERVIEW.md](internal/ARCH-OVERVIEW.md) — concise developer-onboarding file map. Spine file locations, glossary table, and "where to make changes" quick-reference.

## Open plans (work outstanding)

- None. All major architecture phases are implemented.

## Completed plans (kept for context, not action items)

- [internal/archive/ARCH-MIGRATION-PLAN.md](internal/archive/ARCH-MIGRATION-PLAN.md) — multi-phase migration of the extension host + webview to a CQRS-shaped Elm/MVI architecture. Phases 0–7 complete. Archived for retrospective reference.

## Reference / informational

- [internal/ollama-pro-cloud-models-ranked.md](internal/ollama-pro-cloud-models-ranked.md) — model evaluation notes.
- [internal/copilot-model-pricing.md](internal/copilot-model-pricing.md) — GitHub Copilot premium request multipliers, token pricing, and cost mapping for `model-profiles.yaml`.
- [IDEAS.md](IDEAS.md) — unstructured brain-dump. Not a roadmap. Items here are candidates for evaluation, not commitments.

## Conventions

- A doc named `*_PLAN.md` under `docs/` describes work that is **either in progress or not yet started**. When work completes, update the plan with an explicit "closed" status at the top, or remove the plan doc and update this index to reflect the code as the authoritative record.
- Plans under `docs/internal/` are status reports or implementation notes, not user-facing contracts.
- The only file in `docs/` that downstream code is allowed to depend on (via tests pinning invariants) is `STATE_CONTRACT.md`.
