/**
 * Shared tool-call-analysis kind taxonomy: the canonical union types for
 * verification commands, tool failures, non-success result issues, and
 * treatment changes.
 *
 * This is the single source of truth for the four kind unions that were
 * previously duplicated across the extension host tree
 * (`extension/src/shared/tool-call-analysis/` + `extension/src/host/run-analytics/types.ts`)
 * and the analysis tree (`analysis/scripts/contracts.ts`). Both consumers
 * re-export from here so existing import sites stay unchanged.
 *
 * Only the type unions live here — the `*_KINDS` enumerated-value arrays and
 * the coercion functions remain in their per-package consumers (they are not
 * byte-identical across trees and were intentionally left duplicated).
 *
 * This module is pure TypeScript (no Node- or browser-only APIs) and is
 * authored under `verbatimModuleSyntax` so it is portable to all consumers
 * (NodeNext native + bundler). Type-only symbols use `export type`.
