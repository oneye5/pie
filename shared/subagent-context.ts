/**
 * Shared in-process signal marking that execution is currently inside a
 * subagent session (run via the `subagent` extension's in-process runner).
 *
 * The subagent runner enters this context around `session.prompt()` so that
 * extensions whose `before_agent_start` / lifecycle hooks fire during that
 * prompt can detect they are running in a scoped subagent session and skip
 * work that is inappropriate or wasteful there — most notably the skill-pruner
 * prepass, which is designed for the main agent's broad context and adds a
 * 20–35s LLM call (plus a fail-open failure mode) before the first streamed
 * token, making subagents look hung.
 *
 * Safety in parallel mode: `AsyncLocalStorage` is per-async-context, NOT
 * process-global, so concurrent parallel subagent runs each carry their own
 * store. This is why an environment variable is not used here — `process.env`
 * is shared across parallel runs and would race.
 *
 * Propagation: the pi SDK emits `before_agent_start` via an `await`ed
 * `emitBeforeAgentStart(...)` *inside* `session.prompt()` (which is itself
 * `await`ed within this context), so the store is visible to extension hooks.
