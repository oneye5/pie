# Code Review and Quality

## Overview

Code review covering correctness, readability, architecture, security, and performance.

**The approval standard:** Approve a change when it improves code health. Perfect code doesn't exist — the goal is continuous improvement. Don't block a change because it isn't exactly how you would have written it. If it improves the codebase and follows the project's conventions, approve it.

## When to Use

- Before merging any PR or change
- After completing a feature implementation
- When another agent or model produced code you need to evaluate
- When refactoring existing code
- After any bug fix (review both the fix and the regression test)

## The Five-Axis Review

Evaluate code across these dimensions. Use the **Review Checklist** at the end for a final pass.

### 1. Correctness
Does the code do what it claims to do?
- Matches spec/requirements?
- Edge cases handled (null, empty, boundaries)?
- Error paths handled (not just happy path)?
- Tests pass and target the right behaviors?
- No off-by-one errors or race conditions?

### 2. Readability & Simplicity
Can another engineer understand this without an explanation?
- Descriptive names? (Avoid generic `temp`, `data`, `result`)
- Simple control flow? (Avoid nested ternaries, deep callbacks)
- Logical organization and clear module boundaries?
- No "clever" tricks; abstractions earn their complexity?
- Minimized line count? (Avoid bloated implementations)
- Comments explain *why* (intent), not *what* (obvious code)?
- No dead code artifacts (`_unused`, obsolete shims)?

### 3. Architecture
Does the change fit the system's design?
- Follows existing patterns or provides a justified new one?
- Maintains clean boundaries; no circular dependencies?
- No unjustified code duplication?
- Appropriate abstraction level (not over-engineered or too coupled)?

### 4. Security
Does the change introduce vulnerabilities?
- User input validated and sanitized at boundaries?
- Secrets kept out of code, logs, and VCS?
- Auth/Authz checked where needed?
- Parameterized queries; no string concatenation for SQL?
- Outputs encoded to prevent XSS?
- External data treated as untrusted?

### 5. Performance
Does the change introduce bottlenecks?
- No N+1 query patterns or unbounded loops?
- Async operations used where appropriate?
- UI components avoid unnecessary re-renders?
- Pagination present on list endpoints?
- Hot paths avoid large object creation?

## Change Sizing

Small, focused changes are easier to review, faster to merge, and safer to deploy. Target these sizes:

```
~100 lines changed   → Good. Reviewable in one sitting.
~300 lines changed   → Acceptable if it's a single logical change.
~1000 lines changed  → Too large. Split it.
```

**What counts as "one change":** A single self-contained modification that addresses one thing, includes related tests, and keeps the system functional after submission. One part of a feature — not the whole feature.

**Splitting strategies when a change is too large:**

| Strategy | How | When |
|----------|-----|------|
| **Stack** | Submit a small change, start the next one based on it | Sequential dependencies |
| **By file group** | Separate changes for groups needing different reviewers | Cross-cutting concerns |
| **Horizontal** | Create shared code/stubs first, then consumers | Layered architecture |
| **Vertical** | Break into smaller full-stack slices of the feature | Feature work |

**When large changes are acceptable:** Complete file deletions and automated refactoring where the reviewer only needs to verify intent, not every line.

**Separate refactoring from feature work.** A change that refactors existing code and adds new behavior is two changes — submit them separately. Small cleanups (variable renaming) can be included at reviewer discretion.

## Change Descriptions

Every change needs a description that stands alone in version control history.

**First line:** Short, imperative, standalone. "Delete the FizzBuzz RPC" not "Deleting the FizzBuzz RPC." Must be informative enough that someone searching history can understand the change without reading the diff.

**Body:** What is changing and why. Include context, decisions, and reasoning not visible in the code itself. Link to bug numbers, benchmark results, or design docs where relevant. Acknowledge approach shortcomings when they exist.

**Anti-patterns:** Avoid generic terms like "Fix bug" or "Add patch"; be specific.

## Review Process

### Step 1: Understand the Context

Before looking at code, understand the intent:

```
- What is this change trying to accomplish?
- What spec or task does it implement?
- What is the expected behavior change?
```

### Step 2: Review the Tests First

Tests reveal intent and coverage:

```
- Do tests exist for the change?
- Do they test behavior (not implementation details)?
- Are edge cases covered?
- Do tests have descriptive names?
- Would the tests catch a regression if the code changed?
```

### Step 3: Review the Implementation

Walk through the code with the five axes in mind:

```
For each file changed:
1. Correctness: Does this code do what the test says it should?
2. Readability: Can I understand this without help?
3. Architecture: Does this fit the system?
4. Security: Any vulnerabilities?
5. Performance: Any bottlenecks?
```

### Step 4: Categorize Findings

Label every comment with its severity so the author knows what's required vs optional:

| Prefix | Meaning | Author Action |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| *(no prefix)* | Required change | Must address before merge |
| **Critical:** | Blocks merge | Security vulnerability, data loss, broken functionality |
| **Nit:** | Minor, optional | Author may ignore — formatting, style preferences |
| **Optional:** / **Consider:** | Suggestion | Worth considering but not required |
| **FYI** | Informational only | No action needed — context for future reference |

This prevents authors from treating all feedback as mandatory and wasting time on optional suggestions.

### Step 5: Verify the Verification

Check the author's verification story:

```
- What tests were run?
- Did the build pass?
- Was the change tested manually?
- Are there screenshots for UI changes?
- Is there a before/after comparison?
```

## Multi-Model Review Pattern

Use different models for different review perspectives:

```
Model A writes the code
    │
    ▼
Model B reviews for correctness and architecture
    │
    ▼
Model A addresses the feedback
    │
    ▼
Human makes the final call
```

This catches issues that a single model might miss — different models have different blind spots.

**Example prompt for a review agent:**
```
Review this code change for correctness, security, and adherence to
our project conventions. The spec says [X]. The change should [Y].
Flag any issues as Critical, Important, or Suggestion.
```

## Dead Code Hygiene

After any refactoring or implementation change, check for orphaned code:

1. Identify code that is now unreachable or unused
2. List it explicitly
3. **Ask before deleting:** "Should I remove these now-unused elements: [list]?"

Don't leave dead code lying around — it confuses future readers and agents. But don't silently delete things you're not sure about. When in doubt, ask.

```
DEAD CODE IDENTIFIED:
- formatLegacyDate() in src/utils/date.ts — replaced by formatDate()
- OldTaskCard component in src/components/ — replaced by TaskCard
- LEGACY_API_URL constant in src/config.ts — no remaining references
→ Safe to remove these?
```

## Review Speed

Slow reviews block progress. The cost of context-switching is lower than the cost of waiting.

- **Target:** Respond within one business day.
- **Ideal Cadence:** Respond shortly after a request. A change should move through multiple rounds in a day.
- **Priority:** Fast individual responses over a single "perfect" final approval.
- **Large Changes:** Request splits rather than attempting to review a massive changeset.

## Handling Disagreements

When resolving review disputes, apply this hierarchy:

1. **Technical facts and data** override opinions and preferences
2. **Style guides** are the absolute authority on style matters
3. **Software design** must be evaluated on engineering principles, not personal preference
4. **Codebase consistency** is acceptable if it doesn't degrade overall health

**Don't accept "I'll clean it up later."** Experience shows deferred cleanup rarely happens. Require cleanup before submission unless it's a genuine emergency. If surrounding issues can't be addressed in this change, require filing a bug with self-assignment.

## Honesty in Review

When reviewing code — whether written by you, another agent, or a human:

- **Don't rubber-stamp.** "LGTM" without evidence of review helps no one.
- **Don't soften real issues.** "This might be a minor concern" when it's a bug that will hit production is dishonest.
- **Quantify problems when possible.** "This N+1 query will add ~50ms per item in the list" is better than "this could be slow."
- **Push back on approaches with clear problems.** Sycophancy is a failure mode in reviews. If the implementation has issues, say so directly and propose alternatives.
- **Accept override gracefully.** If the author has full context and disagrees, defer to their judgment. Comment on code, not people — reframe personal critiques to focus on the code itself.

## Dependency Discipline

Part of code review is dependency review:

**Before adding any dependency:**
1. Does the existing stack solve this? (Often it does.)
2. How large is the dependency? (Check bundle impact.)
3. Is it actively maintained? (Check last commit, open issues.)
4. Does it have known vulnerabilities? (`npm audit`)
5. What's the license? (Must be compatible with the project.)

**Rule:** Prefer standard library and existing utilities over new dependencies. Every dependency is a liability.

## Common Red Flags

| Pattern | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It works, that's good enough" | Unreadable or insecure code creates compounding debt. |
| "I wrote it, so it's correct" | Authors are blind to their own assumptions. |
| "We'll clean it up later" | Later never comes. Require cleanup before merge. |
| "AI code is probably fine" | AI is confidently plausible even when wrong; requires *more* scrutiny. |
| "Tests pass, so it's good" | Tests don't catch architecture or security flaws. |
| No regression tests for bug fixes | High risk of recurrence. |
| "LGTM" without evidence of review | Rubber-stamping helps no one. |
| Review comments without severity labels | Unclear what is required vs optional. |

## Verification

After review is complete:

- [ ] All Critical issues are resolved
- [ ] All Important issues are resolved or explicitly deferred with justification
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] The verification story is documented (what changed, how it was verified)
