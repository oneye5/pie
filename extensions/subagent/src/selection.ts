/**
 * Model-selection primitives shared by execute.ts and modes.ts.
 *
 * These symbols previously lived in execute.ts. They were extracted into this
 * leaf module to break a circular import: execute.ts dynamically imported
 * modes.ts, while modes.ts statically imported these helpers back from
 * execute.ts. Under pi's on-the-fly TS→CJS transpilation that static
 * back-import could resolve to `undefined` when multiple AgentSessions loaded
 * the extension concurrently (parallel subagent dispatch), surfacing as
 * `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'checkTrailLoop')`.
 *
 * Both execute.ts and modes.ts now import from here; nothing in this file
 * imports either of them, so there is no cycle.
