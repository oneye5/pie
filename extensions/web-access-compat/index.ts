/**
 * web-access-compat — startup self-heal for the `pi-web-access` extension.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `pi-web-access@0.13.0` (the latest release) imports the subpath
 * `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat`. The host `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (bundled
 * inside `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` 0.74.x) no longer exports
 * `./compat` — that compat shim was dropped once its symbols (`complete`,
 * `StringEnum`, `getModel`, …) lived in the main entry. Worse: pi's extension
 * loader aliases `@earendil-works/pi-ai` to a *file* (`dist/index.js`), so the
 * subpath resolves to the invalid `dist/index.js/compat` and the whole
 * extension fails to load. Its three tools — `web_search`, `fetch_content`,
 * `get_search_content` — then become "ghost tools": listed in
 * `pruning.tools.alwaysKeep` but never registered, so neither the main agent
 * nor subagents can make web calls.
 *
 * A second, environment-specific failure compounds this on Windows: when npm
 * cannot replace a file during install (e.g. a previous pi process still had
 * it open) it renames it out of the way as `<name>.DELETE.<hash>`; if the
 * replacement write also fails the real file is left missing and the
 * package's `node_modules` is corrupted, again breaking load.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *
 * At extension-load time — and `pie/extensions/*` are discovered *before*
 * package entries, so this runs before `pi-web-access/index.ts` is loaded —
 * it:
 *   1. Locates the installed `pi-web-access` package with no hardcoded paths
 *      (queries `npm root -g` / `pnpm root -g`, exactly like pi's own
 *      `getGlobalNpmRoot`), so it works on every machine.
 *   2. Rewrites every `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat` import to
 *      `@earendil-works/pi-ai`. Every runtime symbol pi-web-access needs
 *      already lives in the main entry; `Model`/`Message` are type-only and
 *      erased at runtime, so this is a safe, behaviour-preserving rewrite.
 *   3. Repairs `.DELETE.<hash>` corruption — renaming each artifact back to
 *      its original name only when no real file occupies that name.
 *
 * It is idempotent and forward-compatible: if `pi-web-access` drops the
 * `./compat` import upstream (or `pi-ai` re-adds the export) every step
 * becomes a no-op. It registers no tools. It never throws — a failure here
 * must not break the rest of extension loading — but every failure is logged
 * to stderr with the `[web-access-compat]` prefix, and source patches are
 * written atomically (temp file + rename) then re-verified, so a silent or
 * half-written break is never left undiagnosed.
